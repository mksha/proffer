## proffer completion

Generates shell completion script for specified shell type

### Synopsis


Output shell completion code for the specified shell (bash/zsh).
The shell code must be evaluated to provide interactive
completion of proffer commands. This can be done by sourcing it from
the .bash_profile.

Note: this requires the bash-completion framework.

To install it on Mac use homebrew:
	$ brew install bash-completion

Once installed, bash_completion must be evaluated. This can be done by adding the
following line to the .bash_profile
	$ source $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion

If bash-completion is not installed on Linux, please install the 'bash-completion' package
via your distribution's package manager.

Note for zsh users: [1] zsh completions are only supported in versions of zsh >= 5.2
